# DC510: Bring Your Rollerblades
Meetings are currently on the second Monday of each month, immediately following Cyberpunk Cinema at the Knockout SF.


The next meeting is:


### August 14
### Knockout SF (3223 Mission St, walking distance of the 24th Street BART)
### The Movie (Star Trek: First Contact) starts at 6:30, includes some opener, runs 111 minutes, and will probably end around 8:45-9:00.


If you have any additional questions, email
address dc510 at the domain inbox period russia
Please do not talk business over e-mail. If you're going to be late and want us to wait up after the movie (or if you just want to skip the movie), send an RSVP.


**Knockout SF, isn't that..?**

It's SF, yeah. DC510 meetings will always be near a BART station, and if members need that to be an East Bay BART station, we can move. For now, Cyberpunk Cinema is a friendly environment, and it's conveniently close in time and location to Deathguild.


**Why Does DC510 Exist?**

The Bay Area has no shortage of hackers. Around here, you can get ethical hacking classes, corporate hackathons, and (actually) some of the best hackerspaces in the world. It's a high-tech environment, but that environment caters more to the kind of security professionals who attend Blackhat, and less the kind of hackers who go to DEFCON. The real hacker groups in the area are stagnant; SF2600 is a dwindling population that never outreaches or does activities past bar meetings (or actually goes to DEFCON?), and DC415 is now an online-only arm of hispagatos.


**What's a hacker?**

DC510 for abusers of technology. We wonâ€™t fight you over the definition of hacker beyond that. Cyberpunks welcome.
