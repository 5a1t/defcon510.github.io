# DC510: A Cyberpunk Social Club
Meetings are currently on the second Monday of each month, immediately following Cyberpunk Cinema at the Knockout SF.


The next meeting is:


### June 12
### Knockout SF (3223 Mission St, walking distance of the 24th Street BART)
### The Movie (Hardcore Henry) starts at 6:30, includes some opener, runs 96 minutes, and will probably end around 8:45-9:00.


If you have any additional questions, email 
address dc510 at the domain inbox dot russia
the address associated with this github. Please do not talk business over e-mail. If you're going to be late, send an RSVP.


**Knockout SF, isn't that..?**

It's SF, yeah. DC510 meetings will always be near a BART station, and if members need that to be an East Bay BART station, we can move.


**Why DC510?**

DC510 was started to address the problem of stagnation of other groups in the area. The 510 is still hungry.


**Cyberpunk social club?**

It's about the abuse of technology, not hacking anyone's specific gibson.
