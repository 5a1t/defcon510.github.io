**Knockout SF, isn't that..?**

It's SF, yeah. DC510 meetings will always be near a BART station, and if members need that to be an East Bay BART station, we can move.


**Why DC510?**

DC510 was started to address the problem of stagnation of other groups in the area. The 510 is still hungry.


**Cyberpunk Social Club?**

It's about the abuse of technology, not hacking anyone's specific gibson.
